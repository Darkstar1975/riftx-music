# 🎶 RIFTX Music Repository

Welcome to **RIFTX**, a sonic initiative where art, circuitry, and digital freedom converge. This is our official GitHub space for open-access music, audiovisual experimentation, and remix collaboration.

- 📡 Open call for community-driven sonic projects

## 🔊 Current Releases

## 🤝 Collaboration & Remix

We invite musicians, hackers, and dreamers to fork, remix, reinterpret, or build upon our work. Share your creations, follow the licensing, and keep the loop open.

## 🌀 Sonics + Systems

Each piece is designed for immersive listening. Signal flow, rhythmic structure, and tonal layering aim to tap into subconscious awareness and emotional clarity — without telling your body what to feel.
