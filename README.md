💡 Creative Concept

RIFTX channels resilience, digital sovereignty, and self-repair ethics through cinematic music storytelling. Themes include biohacking, decentralization, and the emotional reality of living at the edge of the future.

This project blends music, technology, and freedom of expression — not as protest, but as affirmation.
