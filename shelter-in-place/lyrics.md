## Lyrics

Shadows fall sirens wail  
Lock the doors reinforce the veil  
Barricade the walls inside  
Stay alive while storms collide  

Safe within this hidden space  
A quiet mind a guarded place  
Stillness is the only race  
Shelter in place shelter in place  

Shelter in place close your eyes  
Ride the silence 'til the chaos dies  
Shelter in place breathe and wait  
Fortress mind, lock the gate  

News runs cold voices fade  
Neighbors distant debts unpaid  
Built a bunker in my head  
A quiet room away from dread  

Safe within this hidden space  
A quiet mind a guarded place  
Stillness is the only race  
Shelter in place shelter in place  

Shelter in place close your eyes  
Ride the silence 'til the chaos dies  
Shelter in place breathe and wait  
Fortress mind, lock the gate  

No way out only in  
No way through only in  

Shelter in place close your eyes  
Ride the silence 'til the chaos dies  
Shelter in place breathe and wait  
Fortress mind lock the gate  

Shelter in place  
Shelter in place
