No light no code
The city sleeps systems overload
Street by street the silence grows
Fallback mode is all we know
Radio hums with ghostly tone
We're not together but not alone
Digital pulse replaced by will
Adapt survive and hold it still

Fallback mode we're still alive
No cloud no grid but we survive
When the signal's dead and nothing's clear
We build the path we persevere
Fallback mode we lead the way
Through shadows deep
We seize the day

Power's gone the network fried
But deep inside we still have pride
Maps and manuals fire and light
We navigate the endless night
No app to guide no screen to scan
Just memory hands and human plan
The fallback's not defeat or end
It's where the strong and real defend

Fallback mode we're still alive
No cloud no grid but we survive
When the signal's dead and nothing's clear
We build the path we persevere
Fallback mode we lead the way
Through shadows deep we seize the day

You are the signal now
You are the node
You are the beacon in the dark
