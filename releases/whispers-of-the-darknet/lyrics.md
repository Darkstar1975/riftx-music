Beneath the surface, they hide in plain sight
Whispers in the dark, where secrets take flight
The codes unfold in silence, no trace, no name
In the depths of the darknet, we all play the same

In the shadows, they watch, in the void they thrive
Where the truth is twisted, and the lost souls arrive
No light can touch these places, no escape from the night
In the heart of the darknet, shadows hold tight

The screens pulse with silence, cold and unrelenting
Encrypted truths, forbidden and unsettling
A labyrinth of paths that twist and weave
Where the forbidden dreams and the dark breathe

The hidden corners whisper, secrets with no end
In the depths of the darknet, where we lose our sense
Fading into darkness, no way back to light
Only shadows that consume the night

So we drown in the shadows, where the silence breathes
In the depths of the darknet, where no one truly leaves
Echoes in the darkness, where they hold the key,
