#The Field

Not the wire
Not the spark
It's the field
And the mark

You flipped the switch
Believed in choice
But choice just wears
A borrowed voice

You feel a hum
You name it will
But what you are
Is very still

The field is real
The lie is clean
You breathe the code
Inside the screen

Bright screen dark seal
You don't decide
You're just a flicker
In the tide

You think you guide
You think you steer
But roots grow deep
Inside your fear

A thousand streams
One narrow gate
You ride the signal
You echo fate

The poynting vector
Doesn't lie
It cuts across
The how and why

We dream of stars
Our minds undone
But face the truth
We're not even one

Particles decay
But fields remain
What fades in form
Still hums in brain

Charge persists
The frame unwinds
Time forgets
But the field minds

Not free. Not bound
Not light. Not shade
You're just a pattern
That won't fade

Not blade not steel
Not rule not yield
You're the silence
Of the field

Do you move
Or are you moved
Is freedom just
A circuit proved

You think you speak
You feel, you burn
But everything
Is just return

The field is real
The self is thin
You don't escape
You just begin

No form to wield
No voice to shield
You are the static
That the field sealed

We are not fire
We are not flame
We are the watchers
With no name

No gods no gun
No sword no sun
Just this one fact
We're not even one
