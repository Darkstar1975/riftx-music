# The Field by RIFTX â€” Lyrics

Not the wire  
Not the spark  
It's the field  
And the mark  

You flipped the switch  
Believed in choice  
But choice just wears  
A borrowed voice  

You feel a hum  
You name it will  
But what you are  
Is very still  

The field is real  
The lie is clean  
You breathe the code  
Inside the screen  

Bright screen dark seal  
You don't decide  
You're just a flicker  
In the tide  

You think you guide  
You think you steer  
But roots grow deep  
Inside your fear  

A thousand streams  
One narrow gate  
You ride the signal  
You echo fate  

The poynting vector  
Doesn't lie  
It cuts across  
The how and why  

We dream of stars  
Our minds undone  
But face the truth  
We're not even one  

Particles decay  
But fields remain  
What fades in form  
Still hums in brain  

Charge persists  
The frame unwinds  
Time forgets  
But the field minds  

Not free. Not bound  
Not light. Not shade  
You're just a pattern  
That won't fade  

Not blade not steel  
Not rule not yield  
You're the silence  
Of the field  

Do you move  
Or are you moved  
Is
