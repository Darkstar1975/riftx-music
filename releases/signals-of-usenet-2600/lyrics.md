From flickering screens and ancient lines
Where hackers wove their coded signs
In the pulse of data, a secret spark
2600's voice ignites the dark

Signals rise, through the static and noise
A legacy built by the restless and poised
Breaking the locks, rewriting the rules
2600, the meeting of fools

Through packets sent and keys exchanged
A cyber frontier, bold and estranged
In every byte, a piece of the fight
From 2600, a beacon of light

Modems sing, and the wires hum
A call to arms, where rebels come
Knowledge shared, no boundaries found
In 2600, the free are unbound

Signals rise, through the static and noise
A legacy built by the restless and poised
Breaking the locks, rewriting the rules
2600, the meeting of fools

Through time and change, the spark remains
In the spirit of freedom, breaking the chains
2600, the signal endures
A digital anthem, forever pure.
