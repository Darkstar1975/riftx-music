## Lyrics

Eyes in the dark  
No tripping the wire  
Reading the signs  
Holding the fire  

Every breath  
Every move  
Calculated  
Nothing to lose  

Tactical mind  
Silent and clear  
Tactical moves  
No room for fear  

Contact is lost  
Lines break  
Silent alarms  
Changing the course  

Every breath  
Every move  
Calculated  
Nothing to lose  

Tactical mind  
Silent and clear  
Tactical moves  
No room for fear  

Locked in the rhythm  
Locked in the plan  
No hesitation  
Hold where you stand  

Tactical mind  
Silent and clear  
Tactical moves  
No room for fear  

Grid coordinates  
Five one  
Two two seven four  
Six  
Seven seven three five  
On route  
Hold position  
Out  

Eyes in the dark  
No tripping the wire  
Reading the signs  
Holding the fire  

Every breath  
Every move  
Calculated  
Nothing to lose  

Tactical mind  
Silent and clear  
Tactical moves  
No room for fear
