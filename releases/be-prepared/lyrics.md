# Be Prepared

**Artist:** RIFTX

We live online, we move so fast  
But nothing digital is built to last  
One wrong click, one system down  
And chaos spreads from town to town

Don't rely on just one way  
Keep a backup for the day  
A little cash, a little plan  
That's how real resilience began

Be prepared, don't be blind  
Stay one step ahead of time  
No fear, just be aware  
'Cause trouble comes when you're not prepared  
Be prepared, stay strong  
What feels secure can still go wrong

No card, no phone, no signal light  
It happens fast, it hits at night  
Cyber wars, electric fall  
Will you rise or lose it all

Simple steps, that's all it takes  
Before the system bends or breaks  
Knowledge, tools, a calm mind  
The future favors those who find

Be prepared, don't be blind  
Stay one step ahead of time  
No fear, just be aware  
'Cause trouble comes when you're not prepared  
Be prepared, stay strong  
What feels secure can still go wrong

A little cash, a light, a guide  
When tech goes dark you'll walk with pride  
Be the calm when things collapse  
You're not lost, you've got the map

Be prepared, don't be blind  
Stay alert and read the signs  
No fear, just take care  
Your strength is in the way you dare  
Be prepared, stand tall  
The smart ones never lose it all

Be prepared  
Be aware  
You're the light  
When the world's not there
