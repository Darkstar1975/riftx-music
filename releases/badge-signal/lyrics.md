# Badge Signal by RIFTX â€” Lyrics

**Artist:** RIFTX  
**Release Date:** 26 July 2025

It's not just plastic  
Not just bling  
It pulses  
It listens  
It's waiting  

This is your badge  
And it's not just watching  
It's challenging you  

Flash of light  
Line of code  
Ir-pulse a secret mode  
Rf-whisper  
Led light  
Badge just blinked  
Don't ask why  

Serial ports in open view  
Solder pads with something new  
Crypto key inside the shell  
Scan it wrong  
Might trip a spell  

This ain't swag, it's the key  
To the doors they never see  

Badge signal  
Light it up  
Not just a toy  
It's waking up  
Nfc wifi ble  
Puzzles deep as circuitry  
Flash the firmware  
Patch the soul  
Def con badge  
Not just control  
Break it  
Bend it  
Make it true  
It's not locked  
It's up to you  

Some light up  
Some just hum  
Some unlock when you're the one  
Some link hands  
Form a chain  
Some just buzz inside your brain  

Ir daisy
