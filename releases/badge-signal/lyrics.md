It's not just plastic
Not just bling
It pulses
It listens
It's waiting

This is your badge
And it's not just watching
It's challenging you

Flash of light
Line of code
Ir-pulse a secret mode
Rf-whisper
Led light
Badge just blinked
Don't ask why

Serial ports in open view
Solder pads with something new
Crypto key inside the shell
Scan it wrong
Might trip a spell

This ain't swag, it's the key
To the doors they never see

Badge signal
Light it up
Not just a toy
It's waking up
Nfc wifi ble
Puzzles deep as circuitry
Flash the firmware
Patch the soul
Def con badge
Not just control
Break it
Bend it
Make it true
It's not locked
It's up to you

Some light up
Some just hum
Some unlock when you're the one
Some link hands
Form a chain
Some just buzz inside your brain

Ir daisy chains
Badge-to-badge
Build a mesh with stolen tags
Puzzle paths through led
Decode it wrong
It sets you free

It's not what they gave you
It's what you found
In the wire
In the glitch
In the badge that won't shut up

Badge signal light it up
Not just swag
It's waking up
3d-prints and solder scars
Tracking satellites and stars
Usb a riddle deep
Hack the badge
Forget your sleep
Def con lives in every port
And every hacker holds the torch

It's not the badge
It's what it unlocks
Def con doesn't start when you arrive
It starts
When the badge blinks back

Badge signal light it up
Not just swag
It's waking up
3d-prints and solder scars
Tracking satellites and stars
Usb a riddle deep
Hack the badge
Forget your sleep
Def con lives in every port
And every hacker holds the torch
