## Lyrics

No signal no grid no faucet  
Do I have a filter will it flow  
Just silence and the rain  
A simple need or more than I know  

When the tap runs dry and fear sets in  
Find some water let it begin  
No need for chemicals or plastic waste  
Let gravity work slow and safe  
No need to waste energy to boil  
A simple filter pure from soil  

Safe water's here but make it pure  
Let gravity filter that's the cure  
No wires no codes no lies  
A filter speaks and purifies  

Drink the sky  
Drink the ground  
One drop falls  
A peaceful sound  
No more crates  
No heavy load  
A silent stream  
A clear code  

From top to base the system flows  
Through fine layers water slows  
Charcoal traps ceramic screens  
Purifying what's unseen  

No pump no tap no hand controlled  
Just earth and care the basics unfold  
Rain or puddle turn it pure  
This is life a system sure  

Sterilise once every moon  
Keep it clean keep it in tune  
Boil the core dry the flow  
Water's clear let it grow  

Drink the sky  
Drink the ground  
One drop falls  
A peaceful sound  
No more crates  
No heavy load  
A silent stream  
A clear code  

Drink the sky  
Drink the ground  
One drop falls  
A peaceful sound  
No more crates  
No heavy load  
A silent stream  
A clear code  

Gravity speaks soft and clear  
Water falls no need for fear  
Slow and steady let it flow  
From sky to cup let life grow  

Safe to drink pure and clear  
No microbes no chemicals here  
Every drop a life sustained  
Use it always everywhere unchained
