Neon lights, the servers hum
Codes break through, the future's numb
Through firewalls high and data streams
We chase the spark, beyond the screens

Hack the night, we own the key
Crack the code, set us free
A thousand masks, no faces known
In the digital world, we're never alone

404: Nexus not found
In the grid, we trace the sound
Neon veins, electric skies
In binary truth, the system lies

Circuits twist, the truth unfolds
A revolution in hidden codes
Quantum breaches, endless light
We fight for freedom, through the night

They built the chains, but we broke free
In the digital maze, we'll never cease
We write the rules, we take control
Hack the world, reclaim the soul

404: Nexus not found
In the grid, we trace the sound
Neon veins, electric skies
In binary truth, the system lies

Shifting data, fractured lines
In the void, we redefine
The Nexus lost behind the firewalls
But we break through and tear down walls

404: Nexus not found
But in the chaos, we're unbound
Neon veins, electric skies
In broken code, we find our rise
