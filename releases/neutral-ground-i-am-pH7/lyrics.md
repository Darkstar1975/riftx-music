## Lyrics
They said the system was too big to shift
But I wasn't made to fight it
I was made to tune it
To feel where it breaks
And breathe it back to center
I'm not your hero
I'm the balance you never noticed

I walk the wire, between the roots and screens
My hands remember bitter greens
I code in silence
Stir the flame
Between the sterile and the sacred
I remain

I don't fight to win or burn
I adjust the tide
I let it turn
No force
No fame
No edge too sharp
Just rhythm
Reason
Herbal spark

I am phseven
I hold the line
When it swings too acid
Or too alkaline
No burn
No sting
Just breath and depth
I keep the balance
Life and death

I am phseven
Synth and stem
A healer in the system's hem
Through code and root
Through ash and grace
I find the center in every place

I brew in basements
Blend the light
I speak to plants that grow from byte
I've traced the toxins in the feed
I salt the soil where humans bleed

I don't wage war
I restore
I don't burn it down
I make it breathe again

I am phseven
Not a threat
But you fear the calm you can't forget
A buffer in your sterile war
A green key in your circuit core

I am phseven
Don't look away
The cure is quiet
I'm here to stay

Let it swing
Let it sting
I'll be here when it settles
Not fighting your war
Just making sure
You survive it

I am phseven
