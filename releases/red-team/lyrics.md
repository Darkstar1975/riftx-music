Red team strikes, unseen they move
Stealth and precision, they won't lose
Infiltrate the system, breach the core
Red team operators, they strike once more

Silent approach, they breach the line
Shadows strike, they claim the time
No defenses, they dominate

Red team operators, they own the fight
Systems fall, they're out of sight

Hidden codes, they infiltrate
Systems weak, they leave no fate
Red team strikes, they own the night

Take it higher, breach the wall
Their control breaks, they'll fall

Red team operators, they take the prize
Systems fall, they own the skies

Hidden forces
They strike unseen

Red team operators, they've sealed the fate
The system falls, they dominate

They've breached the core
They've won the war.
