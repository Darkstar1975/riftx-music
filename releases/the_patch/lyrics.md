They told us to wait.
For help. For healing. For permission.
But we couldn’t wait.
So we learned. We built.
We wrote our own way back.

Woke up tired
Same grey sky
Same old meds
That don’t ask why
Told to smile
Told “you’ll heal”
But I was never
Made to kneel

Not a failure
Not a phase
I’m a signal
You can’t erase]

This is the patch
Not from your store
No slick design
No silver door
It’s sweat and tears
It’s makeshift grace
It’s what we build
When they erase
I’m not a case
You can't dispatch
This is my life
This is the patch

Held together
With broken code
Grew like moss
Through concrete load
They said wait
I said “why?”
So I rewired
My own sky

I don’t need fixing
I needed a map
Not one that they drew
But one that fights back

This is the patch
The breath I found
The quiet fight
Beneath the sound
I stitched the light
Back in my chest
No more consent
To second best
I’m not a glitch
You can rematch
This is my truth
This is the patch

You were never broken.
You just weren’t theirs.
You are the patch.
