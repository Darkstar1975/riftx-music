## Lyrics

Food stored system set  
Silence speaks in waiting we prep  
Stocking the shelves time runs out  
A future ready without a doubt  

Cans align plastic sealed  
Grains and beans what's concealed  
Empty space filled with need  
A quiet system we will feed  

Voices lost but we remain  
Sheltered from the coming strain  
Prepared in silence we secure  
A future hidden now ensured  

Feed the silence store the light  
Grains and cans we wait for night  
System running soft and clear  
We are ready no more fear  

Echoes fade rhythm beats  
A whispered hum as time repeats  
Repetition calm and cold  
Stock the pantry stay controlled  

Feed the silence store the light  
Grains and cans we wait for night  
System running soft and clear  
We are ready no more fear  

Empty space the shelves are full  
The food we need the system pulls  
In the quiet we find our way  
Prepared for life come what may
