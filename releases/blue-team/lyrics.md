# Blue Team

**Artist:** RIFTX

Stand tall, I'll hold the line  
Shields up, they can't break through  
Firing back, their attacks won't find  
We'll defend, hold them confined  

Echoes of defense, building calm  
Static rising, breaking fast  
The counter begins, we stand at last  

Counterstrike, we take control  
They can't escape, we've got the goal  

Shield the code, lock the gate  
Their attacks won't find their fate  
We'll defend, protect the core  
Blue team stands, we'll strike once more  

Take it higher, break the line  
No escape, this is my time  

Counterstrike, we won't retreat  
Victory's ours, they face defeat  

The line holds strong  
We rise above  

Blue team rising, we own the night  
They fall apart, we win the fight  

Shields up  
We've won.
