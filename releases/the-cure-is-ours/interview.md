# 🎙 The Cure is Ours — Interview with RIFTX

**[Interviewer]**  
Your new single *The Cure is Ours* just dropped on **20 July 2025** — and it’s one of the most direct, unapologetic pieces you’ve released so far. What drove you to write it?

**[RIFTX]**  
It came from watching the world wait for permission to heal. Whether it’s medicine, technology, or even community support — we’ve been trained to believe the cure always comes from somewhere “above” us. A government, a corporation, a white coat. I wanted to break that illusion. *The Cure is Ours* is about reclaiming the right to innovate, to repair, to heal — without gatekeepers.

**[Interviewer]**  
The lyrics are very declarative. There’s no hesitation, no uncertainty — just a call to action.

**[RIFTX]**  
That’s exactly the point. This isn’t a song for quiet contemplation. It’s for people who are ready to act.  
Lines like:

> We don’t wait / We don’t kneel / We make the cure / We break the seal  

are meant to be said like a vow. We’re telling ourselves and each other: we’re not standing in line anymore. We’re building our own future.

**[Interviewer]**  
You frame the song in strong opposition to corporate and institutional control.

**[RIFTX]**  
Yes. Modern healthcare — and technology in general — is dominated by ownership models that prioritize profit over people. You see it in overpriced drugs, locked patents, closed research. The track calls that out:

> No gate / No guard / No chain to hold / We make the new / From what was sold  

It’s a reminder that so much of what is locked away was actually built from public knowledge and collective work in the first place.

**[Interviewer]**  
It’s not just political, though — there’s a personal, almost intimate undercurrent.

**[RIFTX]**  
Because healing is personal. It’s not an abstract fight. It’s in the faces of people who can’t afford treatment, in communities locked out of their own solutions. There’s a line:

> We are the lab / We are the need  

That’s not a metaphor. It means that the people most affected by the problem often have the deepest insight into the solution.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
The phrase *“one small pill”* repeats in the song — and it feels symbolic.

**[RIFTX]**  
It is symbolic. That “pill” could be an actual treatment, or it could be an idea, a tool, a method. It’s about something small that has the power to change everything — but is kept out of reach. In *The Cure is Ours*, we take it back.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
The sound of the track is both defiant and dreamlike.

**[RIFTX]**  
That duality is deliberate. It’s rooted in synthpop and electronic textures — slow BPM, warm bass, shimmering pads. I wanted it to feel like a rally, but one you could also close your eyes to and drift into a vision of the future we’re fighting for. It’s revolutionary, but it’s also hopeful.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
The chorus repeats with a kind of mantra-like force.

**[RIFTX]**  
Yes. Repetition builds conviction. Every time you hear:

> No gate / No guard / No chain to hold  

you’re reinforcing the idea that the barriers can be broken. It becomes less a lyric and more a statement you carry with you.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
What do you hope listeners will feel after hearing *The Cure is Ours*?

**[RIFTX]**  
I hope they’ll feel permission — to take ownership, to create, to heal on their own terms. The song is a rejection of waiting for “them” to fix it. The cure doesn’t belong to a lab or a logo. It belongs to all of us. And if we choose, we can make it real.
