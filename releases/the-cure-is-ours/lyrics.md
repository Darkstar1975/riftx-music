# The Cure is Ours

**Artist:** RIFTX  
**Release Date:** 20 juli 2025

We don't wait  
We don't kneel  
We make the cure  
We break the seal  

Not your brand  
Not your rule  
One small pill  
Not from your school  

No white coat  
No clean hand  
We build the cure  
We take a stand  

No gate  
No guard  
No chain to hold  
We make the new  
From what was sold  

No fear  
No drug  
No king  
No creed  
We are the lab  
We are the need  

Code the cell  
Crack the wall  
One by one  
We take it all  

Not with guns  
Not with war  
But with a cure  
They can't ignore  

Smiles codes  
Open ha
