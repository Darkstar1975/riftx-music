We don't wait
We don't kneel
We make the cure
We break the seal

Not your brand
Not your rule
One small pill
Not from your school

No white coat
No clean hand
We build the cure
We take a stand

No gate
No guard
No chain to hold
We make the new
From what was sold

No fear
No drug
No king
No creed
We are the lab
We are the need

Code the cell
Crack the wall
One by one
We take it all

Not with guns
Not with war
But with a cure
They can't ignore

Smiles codes
Open hands
Micro labs
In no man's lands

Not their oath
Not their shrine
This is ours
This is time

One pill
No lie
We heal
You deny

No chains
No guides
We burn
You hide

No gate
No guard
No chain to hold
We make the new
From what was sold

No fear
No drug
No king
No creed
We are the lab
We are the need

No gate
No guard
No chain to hold
We make the new
From what was sold

No fear
No drug
No king
No creed
We are the lab
We are the need

No blessing
No price
Just life
Just life
