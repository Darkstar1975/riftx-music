## Lyrics

System cold  
Core temperature falling  
Initiate fire within  

Frost on the glass  
Steel in the air  
One spark one task  
Heat is rare  

Wood wax flame  
Simple plan  
Glow to survive  
Burn what you can  

Hands to flame  
Skin to light  
In the cold  
Fire is right  

Fire within  
Heat the core  
Dark retreats  
Signal restored  
Silent breath  
Smoke so thin  
We endure  
Fire within  

No switch no grid  
But still we burn  
Every ember  
A lesson learned  

Radiate hope  
Boil the fear  
Shelter glows  
Warm and clear  

Feed the flame  
Hold it tight  
Guard your fire  
Through the night  

Fire within  
Heat the core  
Dark retreats  
Signal restored  
Silent breath  
Smoke so thin  
We endure  
Fire within  

Ashes fall  
But still it glows  
From deep inside  
Survival grows  

Flame is life  
Stored in memory  
No light, no warmth  
Without  
Fire within
