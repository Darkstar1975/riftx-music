They told us it's too late
That the damage is done
That healing belongs
To patents
To gods
To power

But we are not broken
We are not theirs

We are repair
We are return
We are the code
Rewritten

They said it's dying
Too far gone
But we still hear
Its quiet song
In melting ice
In breaking trees
In circuits humming
On wounded knees

We hold the tools
We know the codes
We print the part
Where power corrodes
No patent law
No pharma king
Can own the breath
Of everything

Not lost
Not failed
Not thrown away
We build the future from decay

Open source
Open heart
We build from scraps
We make new starts
Print the cure
Not pills for pain
Grow the soil
Not their gain
This is love not in disguise
This is hands and fire and eyes
Not their war
Not their remorse
This is Earth
Open source

No single savior
No clean brand
Just rust and roots
And hacked command
Our bodies break
But we repair
We grow with wires
We breathe with care

We're not users
We're not drones
We don't rent
These skin and bones

We are kin
To sky and core
We heal ourselves
To love you more

Open source
Open sky
We refuse
To watch you die
Not by brands
Not with consent
But with code and love well spent
We repair what they ignore
This is ours and never yours
This is life
No reinforced doors
This is Earth
Open source

Not disposable
Not for sale

We are the fix they feared
We are not the end
We are the reboot
We are the source
