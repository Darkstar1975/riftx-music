# 🎙 Open Source — Interview with RIFTX

**[Interviewer]**  
Your new track *Open Source* is out, and it feels less like a song and more like a rallying cry. What was the spark behind it?

**[RIFTX]**  
The spark was frustration… and hope. Frustration at how the world keeps telling us that the damage is done, that nothing can be fixed without permission from the powers that be. And hope, because I’ve seen what happens when people take things into their own hands. *Open Source* is about that moment when you realize you don’t have to wait for approval — you can start repairing, rebuilding, and rewriting right now.

**[Interviewer]**  
The title itself, *Open Source*, carries so much meaning — not just technically, but philosophically.

**[RIFTX]**  
Exactly. People hear “open source” and think about code, software. But to me, it’s a philosophy of living. It’s about transparency, collaboration, and the refusal to lock life behind gates and patents. The song says, *“We are repair, we are return, we are the code rewritten.”* That’s what open source means when you apply it to the human spirit, to nature, to our collective future.

**[Interviewer]**  
You merge imagery of technology and nature throughout the lyrics. Was that deliberate?

**[RIFTX]**  
Completely deliberate. We live in a hybrid reality now — digital and physical, organic and synthetic. The melting ice and the humming circuits are part of the same ecosystem. *Open Source* treats nature and technology as allies, both capable of healing if we treat them with respect. I wanted that fusion to feel poetic but also urgent.

**[Interviewer]**  
There’s a very strong anti-corporate undercurrent here.

**[RIFTX]**  
That’s because corporate control is at the root of so much stagnation. Whether it’s pharma patents, locked-down devices, or closed agricultural systems — the same mentality is at work: ownership over access, profit over people. In the song I say, *“No patent law, no pharma king, can own the breath of everything.”* That’s the line where the defiance is loudest.

**[Interviewer]**  
Yet the song doesn’t feel hopeless — in fact, it’s empowering.

**[RIFTX]**  
Hope is the whole point. If this was just a complaint, it wouldn’t be worth writing. The song is full of agency — printing the part where power corrodes, growing the soil, repairing what they ignore. We’re not just victims in this story. We’re makers, healers, and coders of our own lives.

**[Interviewer]**  
I noticed you reject the term “user” in the lyrics.

**[RIFTX]**  
That’s because “user” has become a loaded word. In corporate tech, a user is just a consumer, someone who rents access without ownership. But we are not passive. We are not renters of our own lives. We don’t rent these skin and bones. We create, we modify, we reclaim. That’s why I sing, *“We are kin to sky and core, we heal ourselves to love you more.”*

**[Interviewer]**  
The sound of the track — it’s lush, electronic, almost dreamlike. How did you build it?

**[RIFTX]**  
I wanted the soundscape to feel like the merging of two worlds — analog warmth and digital precision. So I layered synth pads with organic textures, kept the BPM at a steady, almost heartbeat-like pace, and gave the vocals space to breathe. There’s a defiant energy, but also intimacy. Because open source isn’t just about revolution — it’s about care.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Care?

**[RIFTX]**  
Yes. Care is a radical act in a system that treats people and the planet as disposable. When we repair instead of discard, when we share knowledge instead of hoard it, that’s care. That’s love in practice. In the song, I say, *“This is love not in disguise, this is hands and fire and eyes.”* That’s exactly it — love that works, love that builds.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
There’s also this refusal to wait for some “perfect solution” or a savior figure.

**[RIFTX]**  
Right. Waiting for a savior is a trap. There’s no clean brand, no single hero who’s going to fix everything for us. It’s messy, it’s collective, it’s rooted in real people taking imperfect but powerful action. That’s why I have the line, *“No single savior, no clean brand, just rust and roots and hacked command.”* That’s the truth of how change happens.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Listening to the track, it feels like a blueprint for a movement as much as a piece of music.

**[RIFTX]**  
That’s my hope. Music can hold a vision in a way a manifesto can’t — it bypasses the logic filters and goes straight to the heart. If *Open Source* plants the seed for someone to think, *“Maybe I can fix this, maybe I don’t have to accept the system’s limits”* — then it’s doing its job.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Last question — if you could sum up *Open Source* in one sentence?

**[RIFTX]**  
It’s a love song for a repaired world — a reminder that we already have the tools, the knowledge, and the will to rebuild from the ruins, together.
