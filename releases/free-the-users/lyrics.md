## Lyrics

In the shadow of giants, code was sealed  
A digital cage, our fate concealed  
But through the cracks, a spark took flame  
Open-source rising never the same  

Lines of freedom clear and bold  
A future untamed a story retold  
No black-box locks no silent control  
Just open hands with a common goal  

Free the user break the chains  
Open-source power no corporate gains  
From locked-down systems to freedom's door  
We build the tools to even the score  

A world of knowledge free to explore  
No walled gardens no locked doors  
Collaboration fuels the way  
Building tomorrow day by day  

Code in our hands the power is ours  
From grassroots sparks to digital stars  
No more masters, no decree  
Just innovation wild and free  

No hidden chains, no unseen hands  
Just lines of code we all understand  
From Linux cores to encrypted streams  
We rewrite the world with open-source dreams  

Free the user, break the chains  
Open-source power no corporate gains  
From locked-down systems to freedom's door  
We build the tools to even the score  

No DRM no silent spies  
Just crystal code before our eyes  
A network woven strong and vast  
A movement built to truly last  

The revolution's here it's ours to code  
A digital world an open road  
From corporate chains to community hands  
Open-source freedom the new command  

The fire spreads the time is now  
We shape the world we show them how
