# Botnet by RIFTX â€” Lyrics

**Artist:** RIFTX  
**Release Date:** 28 December 2024

From the dark, they rise and strike  
Millions strong, they take the fight  
System's weak, they find the flaw  
Botnet swarms, the final draw  

Silent whispers, they multiply  
Flooding in, the defenses die  
Swarm is growing, no chance to try  

Botnet swarm, it floods the core  
They can't stop us, we're breaking more  

Millions rise, the system's frail  
Overwhelmed, they start to fail  
Flooding through, I own the line  
Swarm complete, the power's mine  

Take it higher, break the grid  
Botnet's power, can't stay hid  

Swarm is endless, they lose control  
Botnet strikes, I claim the goal  

They flood the dark  
They take it all  

Botnet swarm, no turning back  
We've overwhelmed, they fade to black  

The swarm is done  
They've lost the W.
