## Lyrics

Check the pulse  
Stop the bleed  
Prepare today  
Resilience is what you need  

Buy the meds  
Stock them high  
For the days ahead  
When the supply runs dry  

Pain relief  
Bandages too  
Resilience grows  
When you're ready to move  

Stock the basics  
Always near  
When life shakes  
You'll persevere  

With meds and bandages  
You'll stand tall  
In times of need  
You'll rise above it all  

Stock your supplies  
You'll lead the fight  
A steady hand  
Guiding through the night  

It costs a price  
But it's worth the cost  
In emergencies  
No time to be lost  

From antibiotics  
To saline drip  
Bandages ready  
For every slip  

Keep it close  
For every need  
With resilience  
You'll take the lead  

With meds and bandages  
You'll stand tall  
In times of need  
You'll rise above it all  

Stock your supplies  
You'll lead the fight  
A steady hand  
Guiding through the night  

Be the medic  
In times of strife  
Steady your hands  
Give the gift of life  
Calm the chaos  
In a world that's torn  
With every bandage  
A life reborn  

Medicine's power  
A life to save  
Resilient hearts  
We rise we brave
