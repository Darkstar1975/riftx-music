# Come Alive

**Artist:** RIFTX  
**Release Date:** 26 July 2025

Same old pills
Same white walls
Same fake smiles
In mirrored halls
But something flickers
Soft and rare
A voice that whispers
You're still there

They patch the skin
But not the soul
They sell you halves
They call it whole
But deep inside
Beneath despair
You feel it rise
Your right to repair

Come inside
Come alive
There's a spark
They couldn't hide
You're not broken
Just aware
Take it back
Your right to repair

They said obey
And you'll be fine
But silence rots
Across the line
Now static hums
Beneath your skin
The signal's clear
Let change begin

You are not sick
You are restrained
Your cells remember
Your real name
No permission
No despair
Just the key
Your right to repair

Come inside
Don't be scared
You were never
Unprepared
There's a map
In every scar
You're the glitch
You are the star

Right to repair
Come inside
You're still there
Right to repair
