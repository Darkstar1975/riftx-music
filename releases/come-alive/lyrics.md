# Come Alive

Same old pills  
Same white walls  
Same fake smiles  
In mirrored halls  
But something flickers  
Soft and rare  
A voice that whispers  
You're still there  

They patch the skin  
But not the soul  
They sell you halves  
They call it whole  
But deep inside  
Beneath despair  
You feel it rise  
Your right to repair  

Come inside  
Come alive  
There's a spark  
They couldn't hide  
You're not broken  
Just aware  
Take it back  
Your right to repair  

They said obey  
And
