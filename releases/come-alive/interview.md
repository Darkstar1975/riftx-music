### Q&A Highlights
**Q:** *Come Alive* sounds like a love song to the self. But is it really?  
**A (RIFTX):** "That’s the trick. On the surface, it’s this warm, reassuring invitation. But underneath, it’s recruitment. It’s our siren song — we’re luring you into our world."

**Q:** Recruitment for what exactly?  
**A:** "For the *Right to Repair* cause. We want you to fix your stuff — your car, your phone, your computer — and yes, your body too. You’re more powerful than the systems that tell you otherwise."

**Q:** Why make it sound so comforting?  
**A:** "Because comfort is how you get someone to listen. If we yelled, you’d block us out. If we sing softly, you lean in. And once you’re leaning in… we can tell you what’s really going on."

**Q:** The repeated ‘Right to Repair’ feels almost like a chant.  
**A:** "Exactly. A mantra you hum to yourself until you believe it. It’s activism disguised as a lullaby."

**Q:** How does this connect to *The Cure is Ours*?  
**A:** "*The Cure is Ours* is the rallying cry — the open rebellion. *Come Alive* is more personal. It’s how we get past your defenses and make you feel like this fight was yours all along."

**Q:** So it’s activism with a wink?  
**A:** "Always. We’re laughing — but we’re dead serious."
