## Lyrics

Connection  
Searching  
Signal lost  

Wires hum, the world stands still  
Empty streets a silent chill  
One command the circuit dies  
Truth dissolves in static lies  

No reply no steady light  
Disconnected overnight  
All control is just a dream  
Echoes fade in data stream  

Signal lost no way through  
Offline world nothing
