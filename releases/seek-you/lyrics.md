## LYRICS

Calling out into the void  
CQ CQ can you hear  

Through the ether a distant call  
Whispered waves an unseen thrall  
From sender to receiver clear  
In silent space connection near  

CQ CQ can you hear  
Across the waves the signal's clear  
Bound by air though miles apart  
We chase the code we trace the spark  

CQ CQ calling out  
Through the void beyond all doubt  
Connection made through silent skies  
A world of sound where distance dies  

The silence breaks an echo's thread  
Through drifting waves where voices spread  
Morse beats carve the hidden line  
A rhythmic pulse a secret sign  

CQ CQ can you hear  
Across the waves the signal's clear  
Bound by air though miles apart  
We chase the code we trace the spark  

CQ CQ calling out  
Through the void beyond all doubt  
Connection made through silent skies  
A world of sound where distance dies  

73 a greeting sent  
Through charged air on currents bent  
Across the bands through night and day  
The voices rise they find their way  

CQ CQ calling out  
Through the void beyond all doubt  
Connection made through silent skies  
A world of sound where distance dies  

The final echo fades to night  
Yet our signal holds the light  
With every call we reach we fly  
Forever free across the sky
