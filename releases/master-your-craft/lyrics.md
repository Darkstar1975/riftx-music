## Lyrics

Every hour every moment  
A new skill learned  
A new challenge faced  

Every second counts  
In a world that's changing fast  
We don't wait for help  
We rise up make it last  

Sharpen your mind  
And train your hands  
Prepared for the worst  
Ready for demands  

Don't wait for a call  
Or a guiding hand  
Master your craft  
And take a stand  

From knots to fire  
To first aid's art  
Every lesson learned  
A piece of your heart  

Master your craft  
Sharpen your mind  
The future is built  
On what you find  

Every step forward  
Every skill you gain  
You're stronger you're wiser  
In sunshine or rain  

The world won't wait  
When danger's near  
Your hands are your power  
So have no fear  

Craft your knowledge  
Through practice and care  
The more you know  
The more you'll be prepared  

No guidebook can teach  
What you must feel  
The strength in knowing  
That you can heal  

Learn the ways  
Of survival's truth  
Every skill mastered  
A tool for your youth  

Master your craft  
Sharpen your mind  
The future is built  
On what you find  

Every step forward  
Every skill you gain  
You're stronger you're wiser  
In sunshine or rain  

From making a fire  
To building a plan  
Every skill learned  
Turns you into a man  

Keep your mind open  
Keep your hands steady  
Master your craft  
You'll always be ready  

Skills to survive  
Skills to thrive  
Master your craft  
You'll always arrive
