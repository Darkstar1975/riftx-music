Through the cracks, the tools remain,
Living off the land, no trace, no gain.
Built-in, quiet, they come alive,
The silent harvest, where secrets thrive.

Living off the land, they blend and stay,
With native tools, no doors delay.
Through backdoors wide, they slip unseen,
The echoes of a system clean.

In every corner, they roam with stealth,
Scripts and tools, they take no wealth.
The system's roots, they bend and bend,
Living off the land, until the end.

Through hidden files and dormant seeds,
They gather keys from system needs.
No flashy tools, no noise, no fame,
The land provides, and they remain.

Living off the land, they blend and stay,
With native tools, no doors delay.
Through backdoors wide, they slip unseen,
The echoes of a system clean.

In silence deep, the harvest grows,
Tools of stealth, the land bestows.
Living off the land, they'll always be,
In the quiet, they're wild and free.
